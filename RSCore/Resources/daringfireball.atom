<p>Kent Walker, Google VP and general counsel:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Today, the court granted our motion for summary judgment in Viacom’s lawsuit with YouTube. This means that the court has decided that YouTube is protected by the safe harbor of the Digital Millenium Copyright Act (DMCA) against claims of copyright infringement. The decision follows established judicial consensus that online services like YouTube are protected when they work cooperatively with copyright holders to help them manage their rights online.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Just look at the detail and clarity. I’ve owned digital cameras that took crappier photos.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don&#8217;t know if I&#8217;ll ever buy another pocket-size point-and-shoot camera. Dedicated point-and-shoots still take better pictures than any camera phone, but not so much better that it&#8217;s worth carrying an extra device. And Flip-style dedicated pocket video cameras? Forget it, they&#8217;re dead.</p>

<summary type="html">FaceTime, I think, is a first step in the direction of a mobile &quot;phone&quot; with no mobile carrier.</summary>
	<content type="html" xml:base="http://daringfireball.net/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>That FaceTime is currently only available when connected to Wi-Fi is, obviously, a limitation. But that it uses Wi-Fi &#8212; data, rather than voice networking &#8212; is an indication of just how big a deal it is. It&#8217;s the beginning of Apple&#8217;s end-run around the phone carriers.</p>

<p>You can switch to FaceTime from a call that started as a voice call, but as <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/apple-facetime-video-calls-wont-use-your-carrier-minutes-2010-6">Dan Frommer reported at Business Insider this week</a>, once you switch to FaceTime, you&#8217;re no longer using voice minutes. The voice call ends once the FaceTime connection is made.</p>

<p>More importantly, you don&#8217;t need to initiate a FaceTime call using a voice call. You can start the call using FaceTime directly, in which case the entire process takes place over IP networking. The advantage to starting with a voice call is that you&#8217;ll get a voice connection even if the recipient isn&#8217;t on Wi-Fi at the moment. </p>

<p>But consider the implications of the fact that you don&#8217;t need to start with a voice call. That means you don&#8217;t, in theory, need to start with a phone. A hypothetical camera-equipped iPod Touch could make FaceTime calls. So could a hypothetical camera-equipped iPad. Or even an Apple TV. This notion occurred to me during the WWDC keynote, when <a href="http://daringfireball.net/misc/2010/06/facetime-devices.jpg">Steve Jobs said that Apple expected to ship &#8220;tens of millions of FaceTime <em>devices</em>&#8221;</a> (emphasis added) this year alone. (Skip to around the 1:33:30 mark in the keynote.)</p>

<p>Today, a FaceTime-capable iPod Touch would not be a proper replacement for a phone. You could neither send nor receive calls when not connected to a Wi-Fi network, nor send or receive calls with anyone using a device that doesn&#8217;t support FaceTime. (The Wi-Fi limitation similarly anchors Skype-equipped iPod Touches today.)</p>

<p>But surely, someday, there will be a non-phone-carrier wireless networking technology with far greater range than Wi-Fi. FaceTime, I think, is a first step in the direction of a mobile &#8220;phone&#8221; with no mobile carrier. If and when FaceTime is supported over 3G in addition to Wi-Fi, it&#8217;ll be <em>data</em>, not <em>voice</em> &#8212; megabytes, not minutes. And immediately, starting today, it&#8217;s a step away from tying your iPhone&#8217;s &#8220;calls&#8221; to your carrier&#8217;s network.</p>

<p>Meg Marco for Consumerist, on Apple&#8217;s updated section on location data in its privacy policy:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Apple updated its privacy policy today, with an important, and
  dare we say creepy new paragraph about location information.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here&#8217;s the text of Apple&#8217;s updated location privacy policy:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>To provide location-based services on Apple products, Apple and
  our partners and licensees may collect, use, and share precise
  location data, including the real-time geographic location of your
  Apple computer or device. This location data is collected
  anonymously in a form that does not personally identify you and is
  used by Apple and our partners and licensees to provide and
  improve location-based products and services. For example, we may
  share geographic location with application providers when you opt
  in to their location services.</p>
  
  <p>Some location-based services offered by Apple, such as the
  MobileMe “Find My iPhone” feature, require your personal
  information for the feature to work.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>How is this &#8220;creepy&#8221;? Location data on iOS is always explicitly opt-in. You, the user, must grant applications explicit permission to access location data &#8212; <em>including Apple&#8217;s own system apps</em>. This policy spells out what happens when you do grant this permission. Whenever location data is being accessed, you get an indicator in the status bar. And in Settings → General → Location Services you get a listing of every app with location privileges, the ability to turn it off, and an indicator for each app that has accessed your location within the last 24 hours.</p>

<p>Philip Elmer-DeWitt, on a new report from Forrester analyst Sarah Rottman Epps:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>But in the text of the full report, and in the accompanying chart,
  Epps estimates that U.S. sales for tablet computers from all
  manufacturers will total 3.5 million in 2010. In other words, in
  Forrester&#8217;s opinion, the 2 million iPads Apple sold in April and
  May were a fluke. It will be lucky sell 1.5 million in the U.S.
  between June and December &#8212; or fewer than 215,000 per month.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Meanwhile, yesterday, <a href="http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2010/06/22ipad.html">Apple announced the three-millionth iPad sold</a>. (Many of them now, admittedly, outside the U.S.)</p>

<summary type="html">Apple&apos;s &quot;Marble&quot; project was not a new system-wide UI theme for Mac OS X.</summary>
	<content type="html" xml:base="http://daringfireball.net/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>A few times since January 2009, I&#8217;ve mentioned &#8220;Marble&#8221;, a secret UI design project at Apple which I believed was a new system-wide theme for Mac OS X. E.g.: my <a href="http://daringfireball.net/2009/01/macworld_expo_predictions">MWSF 2009 predictions</a>, and my <a href="http://daringfireball.net/2009/06/wwdc_2009_predictions">WWDC 2009 predictions</a>. Ends up I was wrong about what &#8220;Marble&#8221; is &#8212; and in fact, it was announced at WWDC 2010 this month. It&#8217;s Xcode 4.</p>

<p>Xcode 4 is still in beta, Apple doesn&#8217;t have screenshots available, and what was shown at WWDC 2010 is covered by NDA. But if you have a developer account, you can get a tour of the new interface by <a href="http://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc/2010/">watching the Developer Tools State of the Union session</a>. It is, to say the least, a major overhaul &#8212; primarily focused on doing more within a single window, even going so far as to bake Interface Builder into Xcode itself. According to several informed sources at WWDC, that&#8217;s the &#8220;Marble&#8221; project.</p>

<p>Another correction I gleaned at WWDC is that the iPad&#8217;s OS 3.2 was not, as I <a href="http://daringfireball.net/2010/04/reading_between_the_iphone_os_4_lines#fn1-2010-04-09">suggested in a footnote here</a>, developed by a team working in secret, apart from the main iPhone OS 4 team. The iPad&#8217;s OS 3.2 is indeed a separate fork &#8212; 3.2 was never meant for use on iPhones or iPod Touches, and 4.0 will not be available on the iPad. But the team wasn&#8217;t separate &#8212; those working on 4.0 knew what was going on with the iPad and those working on the iPad knew what was going on with 4.0.</p>

<p>As for why this week&#8217;s new iOS 4.0 doesn&#8217;t support the iPad, it&#8217;s simply a matter of timing. Apple wanted to start selling the iPhone 4 this month, June. The iPhone 4 required iOS 4. And it took less time for iOS to support only iPhones and iPod Touches than it would have to add support for iPads, too. I still believe that iOS version 4.1, <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2010/03/08/dalrymple">planned for this fall</a>, will be the release that unifies support across all shipping iOS devices. </p>

<summary type="html">As Mac OS X matures, though, and major updates to the system as a whole become less frequent, it might make sense for Apple to start decoupling these application updates from system updates.</summary>
	<content type="html" xml:base="http://daringfireball.net/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>One recurring sentiment I&#8217;ve seen a few times is that some people wish they could delete built-in iPhone apps that they never use, like, say, Stocks or Weather or whatever. What they can do now with iOS 4, though, is stash these never-used undeletable apps together in a folder.</p>

<p>The idea of being able to delete these apps is trickier than you may think, though. If you <em>were</em> able to delete them, how would you get one back if you subsequently changed your mind? With App Store apps, you can always re-download a deleted app from the App Store. Not so with the built-in system apps. And obviously, there are some apps &#8212; Settings being the prime example &#8212; that you should never be allowed to delete.</p>

<p>What Apple <em>could</em> do, in theory, is add a section to the Settings app where you could hide unwanted system apps from the home screen. But that&#8217;s un-iPhone-like. You&#8217;d then wind up with two ways to remove apps from the home screen &#8212; one for App Store apps and another for system apps. It&#8217;s simpler and more obvious for there to be one and only one way to do it, and simply leave the system apps as unremovable. I think the new &#8220;folders&#8221; feature is the best you home screen neatniks are going to get.</p>

<p>Users aren&#8217;t the only ones who are constricted by iOS&#8217;s system apps being tied to the system as a whole. Apple is too &#8212; updates to these apps only ship as part of an entire iOS system update. A bug fix in one system app &#8212; Mail, Safari, Weather, whatever &#8212; doesn&#8217;t ship to users until the next release of the entire OS. When the iPad debuted with iBooks as an App Store app rather than a built-in system app, I at first assumed it was a matter of international publishing negotiations &#8212; iOS devices ship to far more countries than those in which Apple has (thus far) negotiated e-book rights. That may be part of the reason, but clearly another is that it allows Apple to ship updates independently of the OS. The iPad is still on OS 3.2, but iBooks, as of today, is now on version 1.1.</p>

<p>What got me thinking about this wasn&#8217;t iOS 4, but rather Mac OS X. I was listening to <a href="http://5by5.tv/conversation/18">Dan Benjamin&#8217;s The Conversation podcast episode 18</a>, with guests Dave Nanian and Dan Moren talking about the news and announcements from WWDC. Regarding FaceTime, Nanian observed that he wished FaceTime on the iPhone could connect to iChat on the Mac, enabling iPhone-to-Mac video calls.</p>

<p>Sounds good, and one hopes Apple has that on the drawing board, but I wonder if it might not have to wait for Mac OS X 10.7? Apple tends not to release major feature updates to Mac OS X&#8217;s system apps except in major OS updates. The same goes for Mail &#8212; I bet the next version of Mac OS X Mail is going to look a lot like <a href="http://www.apple.com/mobileme/news/2010/06/the-new-mobileme-mail-available-to-all-members.html">the new MobileMe web mail</a>, which itself looks a lot like the iPad&#8217;s Mail except MobileMe shows three columns at once. But that sort of update to Mac OS X Mail isn&#8217;t likely to arrive until 10.7, and 10.7 isn&#8217;t likely to arrive for at least another year.</p>

<p>The only exception I can think of is Safari. Safari is clearly a system app &#8212; it ships with the system, and updates to Safari include updates to the system-wide WebKit framework. But Apple releases major new versions of Safari (and, thus, WebKit) <a href="http://www.apple.com/safari/">independently</a> of updates to Mac OS X as a whole.</p>

<p>With Mac OS X, the problem with decoupling system app updates from the system itself may come down to marketing. When Apple advertises how many new features are in a major OS update like 10.5, 10.6, or 10.7, many, if not most, of those features are not in the &#8220;system&#8221; per se, but rather in the applications that ship with the system. Major updates to Mail (with a MobileMe-style three-column layout) and iChat (with FaceTime support), issued now for Mac OS X 10.6.x, would take a lot of punch out of 10.7 next year.</p>

<p>As Mac OS X matures, though, and major updates to the system as a whole become less frequent, it might make sense for Apple to start decoupling these application updates from system updates.</p>

  <p>To a novice user, aiming at something on screen with a mouse is

<blockquote>
  <p>This sleight of hand makes it feel like you’re running many more applications than you actually are. It also explains how your iPhone can continue to have great battery life while you interact with many different apps. Most of your apps will be frozen and not using power: only the app on your screen is active. And even with audio, phone or GPS apps that are running in the background, you won’t be using more than one of those at a time (go ahead and try to listen to Pandora and the iPod apps at the same time!)</p>

<p>Good review from Dan Moren:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>While formal benchmarking is tricky on the iPhone, my initial
  impression of iOS 4 on my iPhone 3GS is that it’s quite snappy
  &#8212; more so than version 3.1.3. The OS as a whole seems more
  responsive, but there are a couple of places where speed
  improvements are pronounced: in general, the Camera app running on
  an iPhone 3GS seems far zippier now than previously. Pictures get
  taken almost instantaneously, and I didn’t notice any of the
  sluggishness that has occasionally plagued iPhone 3.0.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#8217;ve been running the betas (and, since WWDC, the GM release) on my 3GS for weeks, and I agree. iOS 4 feels faster than 3.x on the same hardware.</p>

<p>Now available for the iPhone (on iOS 4), with over-the-air note and bookmark syncing with the iPad version. Also new: PDF reading (with a great reading experience), the option to use Georgia as the e-book typeface (a great choice on the crude pre-Retina Display screens), and &#8212; hallelujah &#8212; the option to use ragged-right for e-book justification. A great update.</p>

  <p>What would you do if you could travel back in time? Assassinate
  Marilyn Monroe? Go on a date with Hitler? Obviously. But here&#8217;s
  what I&#8217;d do after that: grab all the modern technology I could
  find, take it to the late 70&#8217;s, superficially redesign it all to
  blend in, start a consumer electronics company to unleash it upon
  the world, then sit back as I rake in billions, trillions, or even
  <em>millions</em> of dollars.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Fun.</p>

<p>Paul Thurrott:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Also it’s worth pointing out that the future is cloudy, and that
  my record on prognostication is something like 127 to 3, with me
  being on the raw end of that score. I’m just not good at
  predictions.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Needling aside, Thurrott makes a good point regarding the catch-up game Microsoft is playing against Apple in the mobile space: it&#8217;s not enough to catch up in terms of the consumer user experience, but they need to catch up with regard to what Apple offers developers, too:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>To those who would argue that this is early days and that
  Microsoft’s documentation can only catch up, I’d say, wake up.
  When the iPhone debuted three years ago, it was a bolt of
  lightning in what was then a very immature smart phone world.
  Three years later, everything has changed, and the market in which
  Windows Phone will compete is vastly different. In 2010, it is not
  enough for Microsoft to provide what Apple had in 2007, and this
  is as true with developer tools and documentation as it is with
  anything else. Microsoft isn’t competing with the Apple of three
  years ago.</p>
  
  <p>What we need, then, is not a trickle, but a fire hose. We need
  what Apple offers iOS developers. That’s the bar.</p>

<summary type="html">One week out, a review of WWDC 2010.</summary>
	<content type="html" xml:base="http://daringfireball.net/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<h2>Focus</h2>

<p>Much has been made over the fact this was the first-ever WWDC where the Mac played no role, either in the keynote or in the sessions. But that wasn&#8217;t the only change &#8212; the IT track was dropped from the session schedule as well. The result was a conference that was very tightly focused, like no WWDC before. Even when the conference was all about Mac programming, it never felt like this, perhaps because &#8220;programming for the Mac&#8221; encompasses so many different things than &#8220;programming for iOS&#8221;.</p>

<p>One result of this focus was that it felt more like a single- or dual-track conference. From Tuesday through Friday, WWDC generally has a dozen or more simultaneous sessions and labs in each slot. But the big ones &#8212; the more general-purpose, applies-to-any-iOS-developer sessions &#8212; were <em>really</em> crowded. It wasn&#8217;t unusual to have to wait in a 10 minute line just to get into the room. And on Monday, the afternoon &#8220;State of the Union&#8221; sessions were all filled to capacity. I was in an overflow room downstairs, and even the overflow rooms were crowded. There weren&#8217;t more attendees this year than last, but it somehow felt a <em>lot</em> more crowded.</p>

<p>The tight focus of the conference was, I think, a reflection of the current focus of Apple itself. We may never see such a single-minded WWDC again.</p>

<h2>Attendees</h2>

<p>I heard figures ranging from 55 to 65 percent for the number of first-time attendees. That&#8217;s a good thing, and not at all surprising.  Sessions were geared appropriately, with a significant number covering entry-level/intermediate material. This was especially true for some of the two-part sessions &#8212; the first part was often more about broad fundamentals than technical details. I heard some people complain about this, but I think the programming was clearly matched well to the demographics of the attendees.</p>

<p>If you&#8217;re bored at a session, get up and move to another. Or, go to a lab. (I wonder how many WWDC attendees underestimate the quality of the consulting available from the labs.)</p>

<p>One difference between this year and last is that a lot more of the developers I spoke to &#8212; both old friends and people I met for the first time &#8212; are doing full-time iOS development. Last year there were a lot more who were doing it on the side. And it&#8217;s not just the App Store &#8212; I met a bunch of developers doing full-time iOS app development for the enterprise.</p>

<p>The conference sold out in eight days this year. If attendance hadn&#8217;t been capped at 5,200, I wonder how many tickets Apple could have sold?</p>

<h2>The Videos</h2>

<p>Used to be it took two months or even longer for Apple to release videos of the sessions from WWDC. Last year, they released them just three weeks after the conference ended, and lo, there was much rejoicing. This year, the videos were released yesterday, just six days after the end of the conference. Apple released the videos before I got around to finishing this little wrap-up.</p>

<p>This turnaround changes the dynamics of WWDC significantly. For one thing, there&#8217;s not nearly so much of a penalty for those who skip or who wished to attend but didn&#8217;t register before the sellout was announced. For another, even for attendees, it no longer seems like a big deal to skip sessions, and I feel less pressure when deciding between two (or more) concurrent sessions of interest.</p>

<p>And, more significantly perhaps, this year the videos are available free of charge to all registered Apple developers. <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2006/10/24/wwdc-videos">Previously</a>, you had to pay at least $500 for access. The simple math is that there&#8217;s only room at Moscone West for 5,200 attendees, but there are way more than 5,200 developers whom Apple wants to have access to these sessions.</p>

<h2>Mac OS X 10.7</h2>

<p>There <em>were</em> sessions with wee bits of 10.7-related information, if you read between the lines (or search for 10.7 references in the iOS 4 SDK frameworks &#8212; <em>cough</em>, AV Foundation, <em>cough</em>). 10.7 is clearly proceeding, and word on the street is that it&#8217;s picking up steam.</p>

<h2>iPhone 4</h2>

<p>Apple should have put iPhone 4 units on display in Moscone, <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/x180/354638930/">like they did with the original iPhone</a> at Macworld 2007, if only to inspire developers to create double-resolution artwork for the custom UI elements.</p>

<h2>GCD and Blocks</h2>

<p>Speaking of AV Foundation, <a href="http://developer.apple.com/mac/articles/cocoa/introblocksgcd.html">Grand Central Dispatch</a> is becoming pervasive. New APIs from Apple use blocks wherever there&#8217;s a callback. This is the design pattern of the future for Cocoa apps on both OSes.</p>

<p>What&#8217;s interesting (to me at least) is that GCD and blocks were originally pitched by Apple as their solution to the problem of how to take advantage of multicore CPUs. But all iOS devices, including the iPhone 4, use single-core CPUs. But that&#8217;s the beauty of GCD and blocks: it makes efficient use of <em>any</em> number of CPU cores, including just one. And the programming design pattern results in cleaner code &#8212; rather than having a callback routine with a context parameter (containing information pertaining to the current state), the callback and the context are encapsulated together inside the block.</p>

<p>The developers I spoke to who are using it already really like it. If anything, it&#8217;s a <em>bonus</em> that GCD works so well to create programs that make efficient use of multicore CPUs. And eventually we will get multicore CPUs in iOS devices, and when that happens, apps written for iOS 4 will already take advantage of them.</p>

<h2>The Low Point of the Keynote</h2>

<p>Steve Jobs made a point of emphasizing that 95 percent of App Store rejections are for three reasons: (1) apps that crash; (2) apps that make use of private API calls; and (3) apps that don&#8217;t function as advertised. It&#8217;s interesting to know that these three reasons account for 19 out of 20 rejections, but it&#8217;s a straw-man argument to hold them as a refutation of App Store criticism: <em>no one is criticizing the App Store for rejections because of these things</em>.</p>

<p>And yes, I realize there are in fact people who don&#8217;t think Apple should reject apps for using private API calls, and you could probably find someone who thinks apps should be allowed to crash and falsely advertise their functionality, too. But if those were the <em>only</em> three reasons submissions were rejected from the App Store, there&#8217;d be no controversy.</p>

<p>I can&#8217;t say it better than I have before: <a href="http://daringfireball.net/2010/04/not_the_control_the_secrecy">It&#8217;s not the control, it&#8217;s the secrecy</a> &#8212; that there clearly exist rules which are not written. The latest batch: <a href="http://www.macworld.com/article/151680/2010/06/myframe_rejection.html">&#8220;widget&#8221; apps for the iPad and iPhone</a>. The written rules state that you must stick to the Cocoa Touch APIs and WebKit. So several developers created apps that let you display multiple simultaneous &#8220;widgets&#8221; on screen at once. Sort of like Mac OS X&#8217;s Dashboard, and sort of like multitasking, but using nothing more than WebKit &#8212; HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. </p>

<p>There&#8217;s nothing in the developer agreement guidelines to suggest these apps wouldn&#8217;t be allowed. But, they&#8217;re not. And the problem is that the developers who made these apps only found out <em>after they had created the apps</em> and submitted them to the store. Obviously Apple can&#8217;t write guidelines that cover scenarios it hasn&#8217;t foreseen; but once something new comes up, their policies to handle it should be documented publicly.</p>

<p>The App Store review situation has improved significantly in the last year. It&#8217;s getting better, not worse. But Jobs&#8217;s defense of it had nothing at all to do with the aspects that remain problematic.</p>

<h2>The Oddest Point of the Keynote</h2>

<p>Bringing Zynga on stage to demo FarmVille for iPad was a kill-two-birds-with-one-stone move: it was about not needing Flash (a high profile, popular game <a href="http://theflashblog.com/?p=1703">that Adobe has held up as the first example</a> of what iPad users are missing out on) and, to a lesser extent, it was about Facebook (the current leader in social gaming).</p>

<p>But what a <em>weird</em> demo. Was that guy off-script or what? The demo seemed targeted specifically to existing FarmVille players, because I (having never played the game) couldn&#8217;t make heads or tails out of how one is supposed to play or what sort of entertainment it was supposed to provide.</p>

<h2>iMovie for iPhone</h2>

<p>It&#8217;s interesting that Apple is going to sell it for $5 rather than include it in the system. I&#8217;m not sure why. My theory: most people wouldn&#8217;t use it if it were included free (because most people never edit videos), and those who <em>will</em> use it will happily spend $5 for it. I spent some time playing with it on the demo iPhone 4 units, and it&#8217;s a splendid app. Truly marvelous.</p>

<summary type="html">Apple wasn&apos;t going to include a front-facing camera until they had software that made it useful in an iPhone-caliber way. HTC is happy to include a front-facing camera and leave its utility (and user experience) in the hands of third-party developers.</summary>
	<content type="html" xml:base="http://daringfireball.net/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p><a href="http://techcrunch.com/2010/06/09/iphone-4-missing-features/">MG Siegler, last week at TechCrunch</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>During his keynote address on Monday, Apple CEO Steve Jobs noted
  that while Apple may not be the first to release features, they do
  so in a way that’s the best implementation.</p>
  
  <p>Many people view this as absolute bullshit. But what that implies
  is that they think Apple simply cannot get features done in time
  &#8212; or that they will <em>not do</em> them for some reason. I have a hard
  time believing either of those is the case.</p>
  
  <p>Jobs cited the iPhone’s cut, copy, and paste functionality as one
  example of Apple getting a feature right. I have to agree. For two
  years, everyone complained (myself included) that Apple didn’t
  have this functionality. Could Apple have done it sooner? Of
  course. But would it have been half-baked? Probably. Just look at
  how it works on other devices &#8212; or maybe I should say: look at
  how <em>poorly</em> it works on other devices compared to the iPhone.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is the heart of the disconnect. Those who see these claims as &#8220;absolute bullshit&#8221; are only going to see Apple as getting <em>worse</em> over the next few years. I got a few objections from readers after writing the following last week, regarding iOS 4 and iPhone 4 <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2010/06/09/gray">as &#8220;catching up&#8221; to Android</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The existence of a front-facing camera may fairly be considered a
  “catch up” feature on iPhone 4. But the ability to <em>use</em> the
  front-facing camera to actually make video calls is first on the
  iPhone. That’s one difference between Apple and HTC. Apple
  isn’t going to include a hardware feature just for the sake of
  having it. They only include hardware for which they have
  compelling software to complete the experience.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The objections were based on <a href="http://qik.com/phones">Qik</a> and <a href="http://www.fring.com/fring_is/fring_features/">Fring</a>. But here&#8217;s <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/17/technology/personaltech/17pogue.html">David Pogue on the front-facing-camera-equipped HTC Evo</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>After two days of fiddling, downloading and uninstalling apps,
  manually force-quitting programs and waiting for servers to be
  upgraded, I finally got video calling to work &#8212; sort of. Sometimes
  there was only audio and a black screen, sometimes only a
  freeze-frame; at best, the video was blocky and the audio delay
  absurd.</p>
  
  <p>To make video calling work, you have to install an app yourself:
  either Fring or Qik. But we never did get Fring to work, and Qik
  requires people you call to press a Talk button when they want to
  speak. The whole thing is confusing and, to use the technical term,
  iffy.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here&#8217;s the test. Take some normal people, where by &#8220;normal&#8221; I mean people who have never heard of TechCrunch or Daring Fireball. Give them brand new still-in-the-box iPhone 4&#8217;s and HTC Evos. Now ask them to make a video call to one another. With the iPhone 4, they&#8217;re going to be able to do it. The only thing that&#8217;s technically confusing about FaceTime is that it only works via Wi-Fi (I think many people have little understanding of the difference between Wi-Fi and 3G data &#8212; at least insofar as why a feature would work over one but not the other). Otherwise, <a href="http://www.apple.com/iphone/features/facetime.html">FaceTime is as easy to use as making a regular voice call</a>. There is no such thing as a &#8220;FaceTime account&#8221; you need to create or log in to. It doesn&#8217;t require the installation of any third-party apps. All you need to know is that the iPhone 4 can make video calls, and that the feature is called &#8220;FaceTime&#8221;. And I&#8217;ll bet the little instructional card inside the iPhone 4 box will make that perfectly clear.</p>

<p>How many normal people even know that Qik and Fring exist? Are Android users supposed to install both apps, so they can make video calls to people who&#8217;ve only installed one or the other?</p>

<p>It&#8217;s not that there&#8217;s anything wrong with Qik or Fring in and of themselves. Nor is it to say that Android doesn&#8217;t have its own first-to-do-right features, like, say, the ability to dictate speech-to-text in any text field. It&#8217;s about the mindset of the companies that made the phones. Do you include the half-baked stuff, or hold it until it&#8217;s fully-baked? Apple wasn&#8217;t going to include a front-facing camera until they had software that made it useful in an iPhone-caliber way. HTC is happy to include a front-facing camera and leave its utility (and user experience) in the hands of third-party developers.</p>

<p>Android and iPhone fans will read the preceding paragraph very differently. Android fans will read it and say, &#8220;<em>Exactly &#8212; give us the hardware and let developers figure out what to do with it.</em>&#8221; iPhone fans will read it and say, &#8220;<em>I can&#8217;t wait to get an iPhone 4.</em>&#8221;</p>

<summary type="html">What&apos;s goofy is the idea that Google would do this -- to aggressively change Android from a BlackBerry/Windows Mobile competitor into an iPhone competitor -- and that anyone would expect Apple not to retaliate, to instead just sit there and take it and allow all other aspects of their previous buddy-buddy corporate relationship with Google to continue as though nothing had changed.</summary>
	<content type="html" xml:base="http://daringfireball.net/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p><a href="http://www.betanews.com/joewilcox/article/I-was-wrong-about-Apple-iPad/1276619322">Speaking of</a> Joe Wilcox, in the midst of a 1,500 word piece last week accusing yours truly of &#8220;not being a man&#8221; because there aren&#8217;t comments on Daring Fireball, <a href="http://www.oddlytogether.com/post/684400995/be-a-man-john-gruber">Wilcox wrote the following</a> in response to my &#8220;<a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2010/06/09/battelle">Google started this</a>&#8221; entry on the Apple / Google / Android / AdMob imbroglio:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If Daring Fireball accepted comments, I would have responded to
  John’s fantasy land assertions about Apple and Google there.
  John mimics Steve Jobs, who in March told employees: &#8220;We did not
  enter the search business. They entered the phone business.”
  Steve has since made similar assertion [<em>sic</em>] &#8212; that somehow Google
  encroached on Apple’s phone business. That’s simply not true.</p>
  
  <p>Google bought Android in August 2005, about 18 months before Apple
  announced iPhone and nearly two years before the device shipped.
  Google effectively announced its intention to go into the mobile
  phone business when buying Android. Maybe Google’s intentions
  spoiled secret Apple plans, but there was nothing unclear about
  them.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There are two points worth examining here. Dan Lyons as Fake Steve tried to make a similar one <a href="http://www.fakesteve.net/2010/06/god-bless-you-john-gruber.html">here</a>. One point being that it&#8217;s delusional to argue that Google wasn&#8217;t in the mobile phone business pre-iPhone. <em>But no one is arguing that.</em> Google bought Android in 2005 and the iPhone wasn&#8217;t unveiled until January 2007. No one disputes that. (Note that the quote Wilcox attributes to Jobs <a href="http://www.wired.com/epicenter/2010/01/googles-dont-be-evil-mantra-is-bullshit-adobe-is-lazy-apples-steve-jobs/">is paraphrased</a>.)</p>

<p>It&#8217;s not that Google changed course and got into the phone business, period. It&#8217;s that they got into the iPhone&#8217;s segment of the phone business. <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2007/11/12/a-visual-tour-of-androids-ui/">This is what Android looked like in 2007</a>. Here&#8217;s <a href="http://gizmodo.com/gadgets/android-hardware-in-the-wild/google-android-prototype-in-the-wild-334909.php">an actual hardware prototype</a> from then. It didn&#8217;t look anything like an iPhone, nor like anything Apple would ever be interested in making. It looked like a BlackBerry or Windows Mobile phone &#8212; hardware keyboards and non-touch screens.</p>

<p>Look at those 2007 Android designs compared to the original 2007 iPhone. Now compare a <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2010/04/19/droid-incredible-review/">2010 Android design</a> to a current iPhone. Don&#8217;t tell me Google&#8217;s mobile strategy hasn&#8217;t changed.</p>

<p>Which brings us to <a href="http://www.fakesteve.net/2010/06/god-bless-you-john-gruber.html">Lyons&#8217;s point</a>, which is that it&#8217;s precious to believe that Google has done anything to affront Apple &#8212; that there&#8217;s a &#8220;<em>How dare Google compete with Apple?</em>&#8221; sentiment. But no one is arguing that, either &#8212; or at least I&#8217;m certainly not. It wasn&#8217;t unfair for Google to decide to compete directly against and copy ideas from the iPhone. That&#8217;s competition. It may be angering to Apple, but it&#8217;s not out of bounds.</p>

<p>What&#8217;s goofy is the idea that Google would do this &#8212; to aggressively change Android from a BlackBerry/Windows Mobile competitor into an iPhone competitor &#8212; and that <em>anyone</em> would expect Apple not to retaliate, to instead just sit there and take it and allow all other aspects of their previous buddy-buddy corporate relationship with Google to continue as though nothing had changed. (And to continue allowing their biggest mobile OS rival to accumulate copious amounts of iPhone application analytics.)</p>

<p>Google&#8217;s apparent idea was to set up a &#8220;heads we win, tails we still win&#8221; scenario, where if Android wins they&#8217;d own the world&#8217;s leading mobile ad platform and if instead iOS wins they&#8217;d <em>still</em> have the world&#8217;s leading mobile ad platform with their presence selling ads for iOS apps. What other company, given Apple&#8217;s position, would sit back and let that happen? What&#8217;s interesting is that it didn&#8217;t have to be this way. If Google had kept Android targeted at BlackBerry, I don&#8217;t believe Apple would have unveiled iAds. Maybe I&#8217;m wrong, and Apple would have done it anyway, because it always comes down to money, and there&#8217;s soon going to be an awful lot of money in mobile advertising. But we&#8217;ll never know, because Google started shooting first.<sup id="fnr1-2010-06-16"><a href="#fn1-2010-06-16">1</a></sup></p>

<p>None of this is nice. Competition isn&#8217;t supposed to be nice. (Some companies, though, <a href="http://www.chicagobusiness.com/cgi-bin/article.pl?articleId=32943">are less nice, or at least less trustworthy, than others</a>.) But Google and Apple weren&#8217;t really competing in any important way until Google turned Android against the iPhone.</p>

<p>No company wins in this racket without being ruthless. You gain control and then you use it. The difference with Apple isn&#8217;t that they&#8217;re the nice guys who won. (I <em>would</em> argue that they&#8217;re an honest company, at least relative to other companies of similar size &#8212; but nice? No way.) The difference with Apple is that they&#8217;re the first winners with taste.</p>

<hr />

<p>As for Wilcox&#8217;s arguments regarding user-submitted comments:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It’s easy for John to revise history when there is no easy place
  to respond to him. Daring Fireball is his blog. It’s his voice.
  He is under no compulsion to offer anyone an easy mechanism for
  dialog or response. But his no-comments approach is out of place
  in an era when so many Websites or services provide discussion
  tools and encourage readers/viewers to use them.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don&#8217;t care what&#8217;s out of place. I care about what&#8217;s best.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>But there’s something about the no-commenting approach that irks
  me. John has whacked me and my writing a few times at Daring
  Fireball, but I couldn’t respond there. It was a one-sided
  argument with his supporter minons [<em>sic</em>] adding to the noise.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You write on your site; I write on mine. That&#8217;s a response. I don&#8217;t use comments on Wilcox&#8217;s site to respond publicly to his pieces, but somehow it&#8217;s unfair that he can&#8217;t use comments on my site to respond to mine? What kind of sense is that even supposed to make? And if there aren&#8217;t any comments on DF, how are DF readers &#8220;adding to the noise&#8221;? (I realize, alas, that DF readers do sometimes leave noisy comments on sites to which I link. But how is that an argument <em>for</em> allowing comments on DF itself?)</p>

<p>What makes DF an efficient and effective soapbox is exactly that it is <em>not</em> noisy. My goal is for not a single wasted word to appear anywhere on any page of the site.</p>

<p>Is my soapbox bigger than Joe Wilcox&#8217;s? Yes it is. But that&#8217;s fair, because I built this soapbox myself. It&#8217;s my firm belief that all websites eventually attract the attention and respect that they deserve. The hard work is in the &#8220;eventually&#8221; part.</p>

<p>Used to be, back in the early days of DF, that those complaining about the lack of comments simply were under the impression that a site without comments was not truly a &#8220;weblog&#8221;. (My stock answer at the time: &#8220;OK, then it&#8217;s not a weblog.&#8221;) Typically these weren&#8217;t even complaints, per se, but rather simply queries: <em>Why not?</em></p>

<p>Now that DF has achieved a modicum of popularity, however, what I tend to get instead aren&#8217;t queries or complaints about the lack of comments, but rather demands that I add them &#8212; demands from entitled people who see that I&#8217;ve built something very nice that draws much attention, and who believe they have a right to share in it.</p>

<p>They don&#8217;t.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In July 2009, Missouri School of Journalism’s Doreen Marchionni
  wrote about the importance of “<a href="http://www.poynter.org/content/content_view.asp?id=167324">conversational
  journalism</a>.” She offers good advice for John or anyone else
  writing professionally on the Web.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I happen to know Doreen personally, and agree that her advice is sage and her research insightful. But perhaps if Wilcox had read more than just the title of <a href="http://www.poynter.org/content/content_view.asp?id=167324">this brief piece of hers that he linked to</a>, he&#8217;d have realized that the word &#8220;comment&#8221; does not appear anywhere in it, and that much of her advice describes what I in fact already do &#8212; e.g., her recommendation to &#8220;actively engage audiences via Twitter, Flickr, Tumblr, Facebook and/or other social-networking tools&#8221;.</p>

<p>In fact, I&#8217;d argue that Daring Fireball is, in a way, a deeply &#8220;conversational&#8221; site. When I write, I try to write well, and the incoming attention is mine. When I link, though, I try to send my readers away. I share every bit of my traffic that I can. Do I tend to link more frequently to pieces with which I agree, or which I think are correct? Of course, because those are the ones I tend to consider most worth my readers&#8217; time. But it&#8217;s certainly not true that I never link to pieces with which I disagree &#8212; or which are written by people who <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2010/06/04/df-hn">disagree with me</a>.</p>

<p>Comments, at least on popular websites, aren&#8217;t conversations. They&#8217;re cacophonous shouting matches. DF is a curated conversation, to be sure, but that&#8217;s the whole premise.</p>

<div class="footnotes">
<hr />
<ol>
<li id="fn1-2010-06-16">
<p>Think of it this way: if you agree that Apple might not have ever created iAds and/or moved to block Google from collecting iOS app analytics if Google had not repositioned Android against the iPhone, and if the iPhone winds up the dominant platform for mobile advertising expenditures in the long run, then Google may well wind up with <em>less</em> revenue than if they&#8217;d never gotten into the phone business in the first place. <a href="http://daringfireball.net/2005/08/google_ad_company">They&#8217;re an advertising company</a> that has deliberately chosen to make enemies of a former ally in possession (and tight control) of a rich, fast-growing advertising platform.
