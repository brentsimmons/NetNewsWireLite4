<h1><a href="http://daringfireball.net/2010/06/facetime_ipod_touch" title="Permanent link to ‘FaceTime and the iPod Touch’">FaceTime and the iPod&#160;Touch</a></h1>
<h6 class="dateline">Wednesday, 23 June 2010</h6>

<p>That FaceTime is currently only available when connected to Wi-Fi is, obviously, a limitation. But that it uses Wi-Fi &#8212; data, rather than voice networking &#8212; is an indication of just how big a deal it is. It&#8217;s the beginning of Apple&#8217;s end-run around the phone carriers.</p>

<p>You can switch to FaceTime from a call that started as a voice call, but as <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/apple-facetime-video-calls-wont-use-your-carrier-minutes-2010-6">Dan Frommer reported at Business Insider this week</a>, once you switch to FaceTime, you&#8217;re no longer using voice minutes. The voice call ends once the FaceTime connection is made.</p>

<p>More importantly, you don&#8217;t need to initiate a FaceTime call using a voice call. You can start the call using FaceTime directly, in which case the entire process takes place over IP networking. The advantage to starting with a voice call is that you&#8217;ll get a voice connection even if the recipient isn&#8217;t on Wi-Fi at the moment. </p>

<p>But consider the implications of the fact that you don&#8217;t need to start with a voice call. That means you don&#8217;t, in theory, need to start with a phone. A hypothetical camera-equipped iPod Touch could make FaceTime calls. So could a hypothetical camera-equipped iPad. Or even an Apple TV. This notion occurred to me during the WWDC keynote, when <a href="http://daringfireball.net/misc/2010/06/facetime-devices.jpg">Steve Jobs said that Apple expected to ship &#8220;tens of millions of FaceTime <em>devices</em>&#8221;</a> (emphasis added) this year alone. (Skip to around the 1:33:30 mark in the keynote.)</p>

<p>Today, a FaceTime-capable iPod Touch would not be a proper replacement for a phone. You could neither send nor receive calls when not connected to a Wi-Fi network, nor send or receive calls with anyone using a device that doesn&#8217;t support FaceTime. (The Wi-Fi limitation similarly anchors Skype-equipped iPod Touches today.)</p>

<p>But surely, someday, there will be a non-phone-carrier wireless networking technology with far greater range than Wi-Fi. FaceTime, I think, is a first step in the direction of a mobile &#8220;phone&#8221; with no mobile carrier. If and when FaceTime is supported over 3G in addition to Wi-Fi, it&#8217;ll be <em>data</em>, not <em>voice</em> &#8212; megabytes, not minutes. And immediately, starting today, it&#8217;s a step away from tying your iPhone&#8217;s &#8220;calls&#8221; to your carrier&#8217;s network.&nbsp;<a class="permalink" title="Permanent link to ‘FaceTime and the iPod Touch’" href="http://daringfireball.net/2010/06/facetime_ipod_touch">&#9733;</a></p>

<p>Meg Marco for Consumerist, on Apple&#8217;s updated section on location data in its privacy policy:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Apple updated its privacy policy today, with an important, and
  dare we say creepy new paragraph about location information.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here&#8217;s the text of Apple&#8217;s updated location privacy policy:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>To provide location-based services on Apple products, Apple and
  our partners and licensees may collect, use, and share precise
  location data, including the real-time geographic location of your
  Apple computer or device. This location data is collected
  anonymously in a form that does not personally identify you and is
  used by Apple and our partners and licensees to provide and
  improve location-based products and services. For example, we may
  share geographic location with application providers when you opt
  in to their location services.</p>
  
  <p>Some location-based services offered by Apple, such as the
  MobileMe “Find My iPhone” feature, require your personal
  information for the feature to work.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>How is this &#8220;creepy&#8221;? Location data on iOS is always explicitly opt-in. You, the user, must grant applications explicit permission to access location data &#8212; <em>including Apple&#8217;s own system apps</em>. This policy spells out what happens when you do grant this permission. Whenever location data is being accessed, you get an indicator in the status bar. And in Settings → General → Location Services you get a listing of every app with location privileges, the ability to turn it off, and an indicator for each app that has accessed your location within the last 24 hours.</p>

<h1><a href="http://daringfireball.net/2010/06/marble_mystery_solved" title="Permanent link to ‘Marble Mystery Solved’">Marble Mystery Solved</a></h1>
<h6 class="dateline">Tuesday, 22 June 2010</h6>

<p>A few times since January 2009, I&#8217;ve mentioned &#8220;Marble&#8221;, a secret UI design project at Apple which I believed was a new system-wide theme for Mac OS X. E.g.: my <a href="http://daringfireball.net/2009/01/macworld_expo_predictions">MWSF 2009 predictions</a>, and my <a href="http://daringfireball.net/2009/06/wwdc_2009_predictions">WWDC 2009 predictions</a>. Ends up I was wrong about what &#8220;Marble&#8221; is &#8212; and in fact, it was announced at WWDC 2010 this month. It&#8217;s Xcode 4.</p>

<p>Xcode 4 is still in beta, Apple doesn&#8217;t have screenshots available, and what was shown at WWDC 2010 is covered by NDA. But if you have a developer account, you can get a tour of the new interface by <a href="http://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc/2010/">watching the Developer Tools State of the Union session</a>. It is, to say the least, a major overhaul &#8212; primarily focused on doing more within a single window, even going so far as to bake Interface Builder into Xcode itself. According to several informed sources at WWDC, that&#8217;s the &#8220;Marble&#8221; project.</p>

<p>Another correction I gleaned at WWDC is that the iPad&#8217;s OS 3.2 was not, as I <a href="http://daringfireball.net/2010/04/reading_between_the_iphone_os_4_lines#fn1-2010-04-09">suggested in a footnote here</a>, developed by a team working in secret, apart from the main iPhone OS 4 team. The iPad&#8217;s OS 3.2 is indeed a separate fork &#8212; 3.2 was never meant for use on iPhones or iPod Touches, and 4.0 will not be available on the iPad. But the team wasn&#8217;t separate &#8212; those working on 4.0 knew what was going on with the iPad and those working on the iPad knew what was going on with 4.0.</p>

<p>As for why this week&#8217;s new iOS 4.0 doesn&#8217;t support the iPad, it&#8217;s simply a matter of timing. Apple wanted to start selling the iPhone 4 this month, June. The iPhone 4 required iOS 4. And it took less time for iOS to support only iPhones and iPod Touches than it would have to add support for iPads, too. I still believe that iOS version 4.1, <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2010/03/08/dalrymple">planned for this fall</a>, will be the release that unifies support across all shipping iOS devices. &nbsp;<a class="permalink" title="Permanent link to ‘Marble Mystery Solved’" href="http://daringfireball.net/2010/06/marble_mystery_solved">&#9733;</a></p>

<h1><a href="http://daringfireball.net/2010/06/apples_system_apps" title="Permanent link to ‘Apple’s System Apps’">Apple’s System Apps</a></h1>
<h6 class="dateline">Monday, 21 June 2010</h6>

<p>One recurring sentiment I&#8217;ve seen a few times is that some people wish they could delete built-in iPhone apps that they never use, like, say, Stocks or Weather or whatever. What they can do now with iOS 4, though, is stash these never-used undeletable apps together in a folder.</p>

<p>The idea of being able to delete these apps is trickier than you may think, though. If you <em>were</em> able to delete them, how would you get one back if you subsequently changed your mind? With App Store apps, you can always re-download a deleted app from the App Store. Not so with the built-in system apps. And obviously, there are some apps &#8212; Settings being the prime example &#8212; that you should never be allowed to delete.</p>

<p>What Apple <em>could</em> do, in theory, is add a section to the Settings app where you could hide unwanted system apps from the home screen. But that&#8217;s un-iPhone-like. You&#8217;d then wind up with two ways to remove apps from the home screen &#8212; one for App Store apps and another for system apps. It&#8217;s simpler and more obvious for there to be one and only one way to do it, and simply leave the system apps as unremovable. I think the new &#8220;folders&#8221; feature is the best you home screen neatniks are going to get.</p>

<p>Users aren&#8217;t the only ones who are constricted by iOS&#8217;s system apps being tied to the system as a whole. Apple is too &#8212; updates to these apps only ship as part of an entire iOS system update. A bug fix in one system app &#8212; Mail, Safari, Weather, whatever &#8212; doesn&#8217;t ship to users until the next release of the entire OS. When the iPad debuted with iBooks as an App Store app rather than a built-in system app, I at first assumed it was a matter of international publishing negotiations &#8212; iOS devices ship to far more countries than those in which Apple has (thus far) negotiated e-book rights. That may be part of the reason, but clearly another is that it allows Apple to ship updates independently of the OS. The iPad is still on OS 3.2, but iBooks, as of today, is now on version 1.1.</p>

<p>What got me thinking about this wasn&#8217;t iOS 4, but rather Mac OS X. I was listening to <a href="http://5by5.tv/conversation/18">Dan Benjamin&#8217;s The Conversation podcast episode 18</a>, with guests Dave Nanian and Dan Moren talking about the news and announcements from WWDC. Regarding FaceTime, Nanian observed that he wished FaceTime on the iPhone could connect to iChat on the Mac, enabling iPhone-to-Mac video calls.</p>

<p>Sounds good, and one hopes Apple has that on the drawing board, but I wonder if it might not have to wait for Mac OS X 10.7? Apple tends not to release major feature updates to Mac OS X&#8217;s system apps except in major OS updates. The same goes for Mail &#8212; I bet the next version of Mac OS X Mail is going to look a lot like <a href="http://www.apple.com/mobileme/news/2010/06/the-new-mobileme-mail-available-to-all-members.html">the new MobileMe web mail</a>, which itself looks a lot like the iPad&#8217;s Mail except MobileMe shows three columns at once. But that sort of update to Mac OS X Mail isn&#8217;t likely to arrive until 10.7, and 10.7 isn&#8217;t likely to arrive for at least another year.</p>

<p>The only exception I can think of is Safari. Safari is clearly a system app &#8212; it ships with the system, and updates to Safari include updates to the system-wide WebKit framework. But Apple releases major new versions of Safari (and, thus, WebKit) <a href="http://www.apple.com/safari/">independently</a> of updates to Mac OS X as a whole.</p>

<p>With Mac OS X, the problem with decoupling system app updates from the system itself may come down to marketing. When Apple advertises how many new features are in a major OS update like 10.5, 10.6, or 10.7, many, if not most, of those features are not in the &#8220;system&#8221; per se, but rather in the applications that ship with the system. Major updates to Mail (with a MobileMe-style three-column layout) and iChat (with FaceTime support), issued now for Mac OS X 10.6.x, would take a lot of punch out of 10.7 next year.</p>

<p>As Mac OS X matures, though, and major updates to the system as a whole become less frequent, it might make sense for Apple to start decoupling these application updates from system updates.&nbsp;<a class="permalink" title="Permanent link to ‘Apple’s System Apps’" href="http://daringfireball.net/2010/06/apples_system_apps">&#9733;</a></p>

<p>Good review from Dan Moren:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>While formal benchmarking is tricky on the iPhone, my initial
  impression of iOS 4 on my iPhone 3GS is that it’s quite snappy
  &#8212; more so than version 3.1.3. The OS as a whole seems more
  responsive, but there are a couple of places where speed
  improvements are pronounced: in general, the Camera app running on
  an iPhone 3GS seems far zippier now than previously. Pictures get
  taken almost instantaneously, and I didn’t notice any of the
  sluggishness that has occasionally plagued iPhone 3.0.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#8217;ve been running the betas (and, since WWDC, the GM release) on my 3GS for weeks, and I agree. iOS 4 feels faster than 3.x on the same hardware.</p>

<p>Paul Thurrott:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Also it’s worth pointing out that the future is cloudy, and that
  my record on prognostication is something like 127 to 3, with me
  being on the raw end of that score. I’m just not good at
  predictions.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Needling aside, Thurrott makes a good point regarding the catch-up game Microsoft is playing against Apple in the mobile space: it&#8217;s not enough to catch up in terms of the consumer user experience, but they need to catch up with regard to what Apple offers developers, too:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>To those who would argue that this is early days and that
  Microsoft’s documentation can only catch up, I’d say, wake up.
  When the iPhone debuted three years ago, it was a bolt of
  lightning in what was then a very immature smart phone world.
  Three years later, everything has changed, and the market in which
  Windows Phone will compete is vastly different. In 2010, it is not
  enough for Microsoft to provide what Apple had in 2007, and this
  is as true with developer tools and documentation as it is with
  anything else. Microsoft isn’t competing with the Apple of three
  years ago.</p>
  
  <p>What we need, then, is not a trickle, but a fire hose. We need
  what Apple offers iOS developers. That’s the bar.</p>

<h1><a href="http://daringfireball.net/2010/06/wwdc_wrapup" title="Permanent link to ‘WWDC 2010 Wrap-Up’">WWDC 2010 Wrap-Up</a></h1>
<h6 class="dateline">Friday, 18 June 2010</h6>

<h2>Focus</h2>

<p>Much has been made over the fact this was the first-ever WWDC where the Mac played no role, either in the keynote or in the sessions. But that wasn&#8217;t the only change &#8212; the IT track was dropped from the session schedule as well. The result was a conference that was very tightly focused, like no WWDC before. Even when the conference was all about Mac programming, it never felt like this, perhaps because &#8220;programming for the Mac&#8221; encompasses so many different things than &#8220;programming for iOS&#8221;.</p>

<p>One result of this focus was that it felt more like a single- or dual-track conference. From Tuesday through Friday, WWDC generally has a dozen or more simultaneous sessions and labs in each slot. But the big ones &#8212; the more general-purpose, applies-to-any-iOS-developer sessions &#8212; were <em>really</em> crowded. It wasn&#8217;t unusual to have to wait in a 10 minute line just to get into the room. And on Monday, the afternoon &#8220;State of the Union&#8221; sessions were all filled to capacity. I was in an overflow room downstairs, and even the overflow rooms were crowded. There weren&#8217;t more attendees this year than last, but it somehow felt a <em>lot</em> more crowded.</p>

<p>The tight focus of the conference was, I think, a reflection of the current focus of Apple itself. We may never see such a single-minded WWDC again.</p>

<h2>Attendees</h2>

<p>I heard figures ranging from 55 to 65 percent for the number of first-time attendees. That&#8217;s a good thing, and not at all surprising.  Sessions were geared appropriately, with a significant number covering entry-level/intermediate material. This was especially true for some of the two-part sessions &#8212; the first part was often more about broad fundamentals than technical details. I heard some people complain about this, but I think the programming was clearly matched well to the demographics of the attendees.</p>

<p>If you&#8217;re bored at a session, get up and move to another. Or, go to a lab. (I wonder how many WWDC attendees underestimate the quality of the consulting available from the labs.)</p>

<p>One difference between this year and last is that a lot more of the developers I spoke to &#8212; both old friends and people I met for the first time &#8212; are doing full-time iOS development. Last year there were a lot more who were doing it on the side. And it&#8217;s not just the App Store &#8212; I met a bunch of developers doing full-time iOS app development for the enterprise.</p>

<p>The conference sold out in eight days this year. If attendance hadn&#8217;t been capped at 5,200, I wonder how many tickets Apple could have sold?</p>

<h2>The Videos</h2>

<p>Used to be it took two months or even longer for Apple to release videos of the sessions from WWDC. Last year, they released them just three weeks after the conference ended, and lo, there was much rejoicing. This year, the videos were released yesterday, just six days after the end of the conference. Apple released the videos before I got around to finishing this little wrap-up.</p>

<p>This turnaround changes the dynamics of WWDC significantly. For one thing, there&#8217;s not nearly so much of a penalty for those who skip or who wished to attend but didn&#8217;t register before the sellout was announced. For another, even for attendees, it no longer seems like a big deal to skip sessions, and I feel less pressure when deciding between two (or more) concurrent sessions of interest.</p>

<p>And, more significantly perhaps, this year the videos are available free of charge to all registered Apple developers. <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2006/10/24/wwdc-videos">Previously</a>, you had to pay at least $500 for access. The simple math is that there&#8217;s only room at Moscone West for 5,200 attendees, but there are way more than 5,200 developers whom Apple wants to have access to these sessions.</p>

<h2>Mac OS X 10.7</h2>

<p>There <em>were</em> sessions with wee bits of 10.7-related information, if you read between the lines (or search for 10.7 references in the iOS 4 SDK frameworks &#8212; <em>cough</em>, AV Foundation, <em>cough</em>). 10.7 is clearly proceeding, and word on the street is that it&#8217;s picking up steam.</p>

<h2>iPhone 4</h2>

<p>Apple should have put iPhone 4 units on display in Moscone, <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/x180/354638930/">like they did with the original iPhone</a> at Macworld 2007, if only to inspire developers to create double-resolution artwork for the custom UI elements.</p>

<h2>GCD and Blocks</h2>

<p>Speaking of AV Foundation, <a href="http://developer.apple.com/mac/articles/cocoa/introblocksgcd.html">Grand Central Dispatch</a> is becoming pervasive. New APIs from Apple use blocks wherever there&#8217;s a callback. This is the design pattern of the future for Cocoa apps on both OSes.</p>

<p>What&#8217;s interesting (to me at least) is that GCD and blocks were originally pitched by Apple as their solution to the problem of how to take advantage of multicore CPUs. But all iOS devices, including the iPhone 4, use single-core CPUs. But that&#8217;s the beauty of GCD and blocks: it makes efficient use of <em>any</em> number of CPU cores, including just one. And the programming design pattern results in cleaner code &#8212; rather than having a callback routine with a context parameter (containing information pertaining to the current state), the callback and the context are encapsulated together inside the block.</p>

<p>The developers I spoke to who are using it already really like it. If anything, it&#8217;s a <em>bonus</em> that GCD works so well to create programs that make efficient use of multicore CPUs. And eventually we will get multicore CPUs in iOS devices, and when that happens, apps written for iOS 4 will already take advantage of them.</p>

<h2>The Low Point of the Keynote</h2>

<p>Steve Jobs made a point of emphasizing that 95 percent of App Store rejections are for three reasons: (1) apps that crash; (2) apps that make use of private API calls; and (3) apps that don&#8217;t function as advertised. It&#8217;s interesting to know that these three reasons account for 19 out of 20 rejections, but it&#8217;s a straw-man argument to hold them as a refutation of App Store criticism: <em>no one is criticizing the App Store for rejections because of these things</em>.</p>

<p>And yes, I realize there are in fact people who don&#8217;t think Apple should reject apps for using private API calls, and you could probably find someone who thinks apps should be allowed to crash and falsely advertise their functionality, too. But if those were the <em>only</em> three reasons submissions were rejected from the App Store, there&#8217;d be no controversy.</p>

<p>I can&#8217;t say it better than I have before: <a href="http://daringfireball.net/2010/04/not_the_control_the_secrecy">It&#8217;s not the control, it&#8217;s the secrecy</a> &#8212; that there clearly exist rules which are not written. The latest batch: <a href="http://www.macworld.com/article/151680/2010/06/myframe_rejection.html">&#8220;widget&#8221; apps for the iPad and iPhone</a>. The written rules state that you must stick to the Cocoa Touch APIs and WebKit. So several developers created apps that let you display multiple simultaneous &#8220;widgets&#8221; on screen at once. Sort of like Mac OS X&#8217;s Dashboard, and sort of like multitasking, but using nothing more than WebKit &#8212; HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. </p>

<p>There&#8217;s nothing in the developer agreement guidelines to suggest these apps wouldn&#8217;t be allowed. But, they&#8217;re not. And the problem is that the developers who made these apps only found out <em>after they had created the apps</em> and submitted them to the store. Obviously Apple can&#8217;t write guidelines that cover scenarios it hasn&#8217;t foreseen; but once something new comes up, their policies to handle it should be documented publicly.</p>

<p>The App Store review situation has improved significantly in the last year. It&#8217;s getting better, not worse. But Jobs&#8217;s defense of it had nothing at all to do with the aspects that remain problematic.</p>

<h2>The Oddest Point of the Keynote</h2>

<p>Bringing Zynga on stage to demo FarmVille for iPad was a kill-two-birds-with-one-stone move: it was about not needing Flash (a high profile, popular game <a href="http://theflashblog.com/?p=1703">that Adobe has held up as the first example</a> of what iPad users are missing out on) and, to a lesser extent, it was about Facebook (the current leader in social gaming).</p>

<p>But what a <em>weird</em> demo. Was that guy off-script or what? The demo seemed targeted specifically to existing FarmVille players, because I (having never played the game) couldn&#8217;t make heads or tails out of how one is supposed to play or what sort of entertainment it was supposed to provide.</p>

<h2>iMovie for iPhone</h2>

<p>It&#8217;s interesting that Apple is going to sell it for $5 rather than include it in the system. I&#8217;m not sure why. My theory: most people wouldn&#8217;t use it if it were included free (because most people never edit videos), and those who <em>will</em> use it will happily spend $5 for it. I spent some time playing with it on the demo iPhone 4 units, and it&#8217;s a splendid app. Truly marvelous.&nbsp;<a class="permalink" title="Permanent link to ‘WWDC 2010 Wrap-Up’" href="http://daringfireball.net/2010/06/wwdc_wrapup">&#9733;</a></p>

<h6 class="dateline">Thursday, 17 June 2010</h6>

<p><a href="http://techcrunch.com/2010/06/09/iphone-4-missing-features/">MG Siegler, last week at TechCrunch</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>During his keynote address on Monday, Apple CEO Steve Jobs noted
  that while Apple may not be the first to release features, they do
  so in a way that’s the best implementation.</p>
  
  <p>Many people view this as absolute bullshit. But what that implies
  is that they think Apple simply cannot get features done in time
  &#8212; or that they will <em>not do</em> them for some reason. I have a hard
  time believing either of those is the case.</p>
  
  <p>Jobs cited the iPhone’s cut, copy, and paste functionality as one
  example of Apple getting a feature right. I have to agree. For two
  years, everyone complained (myself included) that Apple didn’t
  have this functionality. Could Apple have done it sooner? Of
  course. But would it have been half-baked? Probably. Just look at
  how it works on other devices &#8212; or maybe I should say: look at
  how <em>poorly</em> it works on other devices compared to the iPhone.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is the heart of the disconnect. Those who see these claims as &#8220;absolute bullshit&#8221; are only going to see Apple as getting <em>worse</em> over the next few years. I got a few objections from readers after writing the following last week, regarding iOS 4 and iPhone 4 <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2010/06/09/gray">as &#8220;catching up&#8221; to Android</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The existence of a front-facing camera may fairly be considered a
  “catch up” feature on iPhone 4. But the ability to <em>use</em> the
  front-facing camera to actually make video calls is first on the
  iPhone. That’s one difference between Apple and HTC. Apple
  isn’t going to include a hardware feature just for the sake of
  having it. They only include hardware for which they have
  compelling software to complete the experience.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The objections were based on <a href="http://qik.com/phones">Qik</a> and <a href="http://www.fring.com/fring_is/fring_features/">Fring</a>. But here&#8217;s <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/17/technology/personaltech/17pogue.html">David Pogue on the front-facing-camera-equipped HTC Evo</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>After two days of fiddling, downloading and uninstalling apps,
  manually force-quitting programs and waiting for servers to be
  upgraded, I finally got video calling to work &#8212; sort of. Sometimes
  there was only audio and a black screen, sometimes only a
  freeze-frame; at best, the video was blocky and the audio delay
  absurd.</p>
  
  <p>To make video calling work, you have to install an app yourself:
  either Fring or Qik. But we never did get Fring to work, and Qik
  requires people you call to press a Talk button when they want to
  speak. The whole thing is confusing and, to use the technical term,
  iffy.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here&#8217;s the test. Take some normal people, where by &#8220;normal&#8221; I mean people who have never heard of TechCrunch or Daring Fireball. Give them brand new still-in-the-box iPhone 4&#8217;s and HTC Evos. Now ask them to make a video call to one another. With the iPhone 4, they&#8217;re going to be able to do it. The only thing that&#8217;s technically confusing about FaceTime is that it only works via Wi-Fi (I think many people have little understanding of the difference between Wi-Fi and 3G data &#8212; at least insofar as why a feature would work over one but not the other). Otherwise, <a href="http://www.apple.com/iphone/features/facetime.html">FaceTime is as easy to use as making a regular voice call</a>. There is no such thing as a &#8220;FaceTime account&#8221; you need to create or log in to. It doesn&#8217;t require the installation of any third-party apps. All you need to know is that the iPhone 4 can make video calls, and that the feature is called &#8220;FaceTime&#8221;. And I&#8217;ll bet the little instructional card inside the iPhone 4 box will make that perfectly clear.</p>

<p>How many normal people even know that Qik and Fring exist? Are Android users supposed to install both apps, so they can make video calls to people who&#8217;ve only installed one or the other?</p>

<p>It&#8217;s not that there&#8217;s anything wrong with Qik or Fring in and of themselves. Nor is it to say that Android doesn&#8217;t have its own first-to-do-right features, like, say, the ability to dictate speech-to-text in any text field. It&#8217;s about the mindset of the companies that made the phones. Do you include the half-baked stuff, or hold it until it&#8217;s fully-baked? Apple wasn&#8217;t going to include a front-facing camera until they had software that made it useful in an iPhone-caliber way. HTC is happy to include a front-facing camera and leave its utility (and user experience) in the hands of third-party developers.</p>

<p>Android and iPhone fans will read the preceding paragraph very differently. Android fans will read it and say, &#8220;<em>Exactly &#8212; give us the hardware and let developers figure out what to do with it.</em>&#8221; iPhone fans will read it and say, &#8220;<em>I can&#8217;t wait to get an iPhone 4.</em>&#8221;&nbsp;<a class="permalink" title="Permanent link to ‘‘First to Do It’ vs. ‘First to Do It Right’’" href="http://daringfireball.net/2010/06/first">&#9733;</a></p>
