<h1>How to share articles with other people</h1>


<h4>Mail link</h4>

<p>To send someone a link to an article via email, choose <span class="ui">Mail Link</span> from the <span class="ui">Share</span> menu. It will open a new message window in your email application with the link to the article. You can edit the message before sending.</p>

<p>If this is something you do often, you might want to change the way the email is created. For instance, every email has a tagline that says “Link found via NetNewsWire for Macintosh: http://netnewswireapp.com/” at the bottom. While we appreciate if you left that there, you don’t have to. You can create your own template for the body of the email. Here’s how.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Create a text file for your template, and save it to <code>&#91;your home folder]/Library/Application Support/NetNewsWire Lite/Templates/EmailLinkBodyTemplate</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>The template text can be whatever you want — as long as it has a <code>&#91;&#91;url&#93;&#93;</code>in it. That part gets replaced with the actual URL.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>You can do the same thing for the title of the email, except that you need to include <code>&#91;&#91;title&#93;&#93;</code>, which gets replaced by the title. The filename for the title of the email template is <code>EmailLinkTitleTemplate</code>.</p>

<h4>Send to Instapaper</h4>

<p><a href="http://www.instapaper.com/">Instapaper</a> is a popular service for saving things to read later. It requires a username and (optional-though-recommended) password.</p>

<p>To save an article or web page to Instapaper, choose <span class="ui">Send to Instapaper</span> from the <span class="ui">Share</span> menu. (Okay, you’re really just sharing with yourself for later, but this command still fits in with the Share menu.)</p>

<p>NetNewsWire will ask for your username and password when needed. You can always change them in NetNewsWire’s preferences window.</p>

<h4>Send to Application</h4>

<p>NetNewsWire supports a number of other applications that you can send links to: Twitter for Mac, VoodooPad, MarsEdit, Delibar, and more.</p>

<p>Some of these apps post to Twitter; some post to a weblog (MarsEdit); some post to bookmark services (Delibar, for instance, posts to Pinboard); some just save locally (VoodooPad).</p>

<p>NetNewsWire finds out which of these apps you have and just displays the ones that are actually on your hard drive.</p>

<p>To send a link to one of these apps, select an article or open a web page, then choose the app from the <span class="ui">Share</span> menu.</p>

<h4>Adding to the toolbar</h4>

<p>You might do some one or a few of these commands often. You can add them to your toolbar for quick access.</p>

<p>From the <span class="ui">View</span> menu, choose <span class="ui">Customize Toolbar…</span> Then add whichever commands you’d like to your toolbar.</p>
