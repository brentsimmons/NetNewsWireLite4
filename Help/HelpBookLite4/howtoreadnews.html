<h1>How to read news</h1>


<h4>Use the space bar</h4>

<p>The easiest way to go through your news is to just keep hitting the <span class="ui">space bar</span>.</p>

<p>If the current article has anything to scroll, it will scroll — this way you can read it to the end.</p>

<p>If there’s nothing left to scroll, then it will go to the next unread article.</p>

<p>You can read <em>everything</em> just by hitting the space bar.</p>

<h4>Next Unread</h4>

<p>After the space bar, the most important thing is the Next Unread command. There’s a button in the toolbar for it — but you can also just hit the <span class="ui">'</span> key. (That’s the apostrophe without any other key — just the <span class="ui">'</span> key.)</p>

<h4>Marking articles as read and unread</h4>

<p>You might want to mark an individual article as read or unread. The <span class="ui">m</span> key (no other keys needed) will toggle between read and unread.</p>

<p>You can also click on the blue button to the left of the title to mark it as read. Or click where that blue button <i>would</i> be to mark it as unread. (That’s slightly weird, yes. But it works.)</p>

<p>To mark an entire list as read, click the <span class="ui">Mark All as Read</span> button in the toolbar. Or type <span class="ui">cmd-K</span>.</p>

<p>(You can undo mark-all-as-read.)</p>

<h4>Seeing only unread articles</h4>

<p>To view all your unread article in a single list, click on <span class="ui">All Unread</span> in the upper-left of the NetNewsWire window. Or type cmd-1.</p>

<p>To view just articles from today, click on <span class="ui">Today</span> in the upper-left. Or type cmd-2.</p>

<h4>Navigating</h4>

<p>Left and right arrow keys will take you from the list of feeds to the articles list. Hitting right arrow while in the articles list will open that article’s web page — either in NetNewsWire (the default) or in your web browser.</p>

<p>If you’ve opened an article’s web page in NetNewsWire, typing left-arrow will close it and bring you back to the articles list.</p>

<p>You can also use some swipe gestures, if you have a mouse or trackpad that supports those. For instance, a swipe-right in the articles list will open the web page for that article. Swiping up or down will move up and down in the articles list.</p>

<h4>Customizing the look of articles</h4>

<p>NetNewsWire includes a few different themes for articles — see the popup menu in the upper-right in the toolbar. You can choose the one you like best.</p>

<p>Themes from older versions of NetNewsWire should also work. If you want to make your own themes, you can — we don’t have documentation up yet (at this writing), but we will. (It will appear on the <a href="http://ranchero.com/nnwtechnotes/">NetNewsWire Technotes site</a>. It might be there by now.)</p>
