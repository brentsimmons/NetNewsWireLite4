@title How to Delete Feeds

To delete a feed or a folder, select the feed or folder, then click the Minus button in the toolbar. (Or type <span class="ui">cmd-Delete</span>.)

Deleting a feed or folder canâ€™t be undone, so a confirmation warning will appear. After you confirm that it should be deleted, it will be removed.
