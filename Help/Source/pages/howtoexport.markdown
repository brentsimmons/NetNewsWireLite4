@title How to export feeds to another reader

If you want to try out another reader, you can copy your feeds from NetNewsWire to that other reader.

Most (maybe all?) readers support a format called OPML. (For the curious: you can find out more about OPML at <a href="http://www.opml.org/">opml.org</a>.)

To make a copy of your feeds that another reader can import, do this:

1. Choose <span class="ui">File > Export Feeds…</span>.

2. In the save sheet that appears, choose a location for the file, then click Save.

Now you have a file — probably called MySubscriptions.opml, though you might have changed the name — that you can import into another reader. (Consult the documentation of that other reader for how to import an OPML file.)
