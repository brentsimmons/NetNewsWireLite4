@title How to share articles with other people

#### Mail link

To send someone a link to an article via email, choose <span class="ui">Mail Link</span> from the <span class="ui">Share</span> menu. It will open a new message window in your email application with the link to the article. You can edit the message before sending.

If this is something you do often, you might want to change the way the email is created. For instance, every email has a tagline that says “Link found via NetNewsWire for Macintosh: http://netnewswireapp.com/” at the bottom. While we appreciate if you left that there, you don’t have to. You can create your own template for the body of the email. Here’s how.

1. Create a text file for your template, and save it to <code>&#91;your home folder]/Library/Application Support/NetNewsWireLite4/Templates/EmailLinkBodyTemplate</code>.

2. The template text can be whatever you want — as long as it has a <code>&#91;&#91;url&#93;&#93;</code>in it. That part gets replaced with the actual URL.

You can do the same thing for the title of the email, except that you need to include <code>&#91;&#91;title&#93;&#93;</code>, which gets replaced by the title. The filename for the title of the email template is <code>EmailLinkTitleTemplate</code>.

#### Send to Instapaper

<a href="http://www.instapaper.com/">Instapaper</a> is a popular service for saving things to read later. It requires a username and (optional-though-recommended) password.

To save an article or web page to Instapaper, choose <span class="ui">Send to Instapaper</span> from the <span class="ui">Share</span> menu. (Okay, you’re really just sharing with yourself for later, but this command still fits in with the Share menu.)

NetNewsWire will ask for your username and password when needed. You can always change them in NetNewsWire’s preferences window.

#### Send to Application

NetNewsWire supports a number of other applications that you can send links to: Twitter for Mac, VoodooPad, MarsEdit, Delibar, and more.

Some of these apps post to Twitter; some post to a weblog (MarsEdit); some post to bookmark services (Delibar, for instance, posts to Pinboard); some just save locally (VoodooPad).

NetNewsWire finds out which of these apps you have and just displays the ones that are actually on your hard drive.

To send a link to one of these apps, select an article or open a web page, then choose the app from the <span class="ui">Share</span> menu.

#### Adding to the toolbar

You might do some one or a few of these commands often. You can add them to your toolbar for quick access.

From the <span class="ui">View</span> menu, choose <span class="ui">Customize Toolbar…</span> Then add whichever commands you’d like to your toolbar.
