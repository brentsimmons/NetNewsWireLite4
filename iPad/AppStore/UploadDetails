App Store submission 22 March 2010:

### Application Name

NetNewsWire

### Application Description:

NetNewsWire is an RSS reader for iPad — you can read news from the millions of weblogs and sites that publish RSS feeds.

Because NetNewsWire syncs with Google Reader (Google account required) — and with NetNewsWire for Macintosh and iPhone and with FeedDemon for Windows by NewsGator — if you read an item on your iPad, you don’t have to read it again your Macintosh or iPhone. It’s automatically marked as read everywhere.

You can star items or send them to Instapaper to save them for later. You can email articles or post links to Twitter to share with friends.

Going through your articles is easy: just tap the Next Unread button.
