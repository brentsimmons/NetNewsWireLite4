Stop clicking bookmarks — let NetNewsWire Lite show you what’s new in your favorite websites.

NetNewsWire Lite reads RSS and Atom feeds and shows you what articles you haven’t read so you can read them right there, in the app.

You can go through all your news just by hitting the space bar — it’s easy. Read the original web page just by clicking a link or hitting the right-arrow key.

When you find something to save or share, you can email a link, save to Instapaper, or send to another app (such as Delibar, Twitter for Mac, VoodooPad, MarsEdit, and more).

Adding feeds is easy — most of the time NetNewsWire Lite can find a feed for a website for you, so you don’t have to hunt. And you can add a feed to NetNewsWire Lite directly from Safari.

NetNewsWire Lite supports authenticated feeds too, for any in-house and private feeds.

And the app is fast and light, easy-to-navigate, with just the features you need to be able to read your news.
