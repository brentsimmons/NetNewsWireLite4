Description:

NetNewsWire is an RSS reader for iPhone — you can read news from the millions of weblogs and sites that publish RSS feeds.

Because NetNewsWire syncs with Google Reader (Google account required) — and with NetNewsWire for Macintosh and FeedDemon for Windows by NewsGator — if you read an item on your iPhone, you don’t have to read it again on your Macintosh or other computer. It’s automatically marked as read everywhere.

You can star items or send them to Instapaper to save them for later. You can email articles or post links to Twitter to share with friends.

Going through your articles is easy: just tap the Next Unread button.

And if there are feeds you don’t want to read on your iPhone, you can hide them.

The premium version of NetNewsWire is ad-free.

New:

This new version syncs with Google Reader.

There have been lots of performance enhancements since NetNewsWire 1.0 — it’s an entirely new application.

You can expand and collapse folders.

You can save to Instapaper, send to Twitter, or send email without leaving the application.

There are new views for starred items and for latest news (published in the last 24 hours).

New application icon.

New up and down arrows for navigating through your news list.

Richer display: title and date of most recent item on Feeds screen. Excerpts and dates on news item lists.
